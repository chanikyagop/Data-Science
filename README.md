# Data-Science
The growth of e-commerce websites has led to an overwhelming amount of product options for customers. To address this, recommendation systems have emerged as a critical tool for improving the customer experience by predicting user preferences and suggesting products tailored to their needs.
This project focuses on developing a personalized recommendation system for an e-commerce platform, which has significant potential to enhance the user experience and increase sales. The dataset used in this project contains user-item interaction data, including user ratings and product information. The methodology includes implementing two popular collaborative filtering algorithms, item-based and model-based, to identify which approach yields better results in predicting user preferences and recommending products. 
One of the key features of this project is the comparison of the two collaborative filtering methodologies to determine which approach performs better and is more applicable in real-world scenarios. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of data preprocessing and feature engineering in improving the accuracy of recommendation systems. Overall, this project provides valuable insights into the development and evaluation of personalized recommendation systems for e-commerce platforms, which can benefit both customers and businesses
